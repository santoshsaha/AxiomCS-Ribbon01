*1.1.29*
14 October 2015
- bug! Attaching a non-tempalte document to a version and then reopening could delete the original file.  Fix.
- also, fix the saving of manually attached word docs and add a button to export to the toolbar
- fix the issue with Cloning a clause where there was two concepts with the same name in Salesforce.

*1.1.28*
2 October 2015
- fixes - problem with editing templates that had clauses where there was more than one instance of that name in Salesforce
  the generic save code was setting the value in the dropdown by the name not the value which could cause issues with the dupes
- make the concept on the clause edit in the sidebar readonly
- speed - stop loading all the clauses each time the clause dialog is opened - refresh button will refresh otherwise only does it on an add
- add sort and limit when looking for Template.docx attachments - this will make it behave correctly even if there are two attachments with same name

*1.1.27*
21 September 2015
- Added Clean up button to the Template builder - sorts out orphans and dupes

*1.1.26*
14 September 2015
- Problem with API - complext type has been added to the wsdl causing an error when it gets the layout description
  added the type to the wsdl so we can stay on 29 without having to test everything else

*1.1.25*
14 September 2015
- Issue wih the Import - introduced with the template clone - fix
- On the Clone add in truncating of the names so we don't have save issues

*1.1.24*
8 September 2015
- Issue with Client/Info playbook update - if you updated one it blanked the other - simple fix
- Template Clone - allow cloning of templates either cloning all the concept clauses or just reusing.
- Debug Panel in Template editor - Export/Import Playbook info - need for fix because of a cipher issue

*1.1.23*
23 August 2015
Another bug in the Import - Templates can have orphan Elements - the delete of the clause must not delete out the elements (need to come back for that)
For now get the import to do the clean up and NOT break to fix Blanche's issue

*1.1.22*
20 August 2015
Bug in the Import if there are no Elements or no Clauses - add a bit of null detection!
Add the instance you are logged into to the Import dialog

*1.1.21*
17 August 2015
** Export/Import of Templates
Blanche bug - not being able to see the Clockstopper you created in the task list - problem is the task veiw is pages so the 
the created clockstopper can be on the next page *so* add a filter "Open Clockstopper" to the Activity view and change the filter
selection after clockstopper to "Open Clockstopper" - this means that when you create a clockstopper you always get this filter
either in the task object or in the Matter/Task view.  On the Task view this is sorted in createddate desc order so the new clockstopper
will be on the page

Brent bug - element formatting not possible, you couldn't set the format of an element in the template and then have that be reflected in the Contract
fix invlovel changing the element in the template editor so you can edit it *and* on the clause when the values is replaced it remember the format
of the control (other wise when you change the text in the range it wipes the formatting) ALSO have to copy the font and then reaplly it after the change


*1.1.20*
11 August 2015
Set of changes!
Compare Menu in Contract - does a word comparison between the current version and any new versions
Allow Select None on a Concept - lets the user select None for a clause, always adds it at the end
(requires AllowNone__c field on RibbonConcept)
Default Element tie to Version/Matter/Request - if default value starts with a "=" and is in the form =Matter.Name then it will default to that value
Default Clause tie to Version/Matter/Request - can set the clause to be the default option by setting DefaultSelection__c field to the field and value
e.g. Matter.Name=Name123 - can have multiples by doing Matter.Name=Name123|Matter.Name=Name456
(requires DefaultSelection__c field on RibbonTemplateClause)

*1.1.19*
5 August 2015
Support the User object - doesn't have record types - just needed to adjust some of the code

->Save As New Version
->UnAttach
->Export
New Contract Sidebar with Clause choice and Data.  Big new set of editing, get rid of save as word and save as pdf - now assume we have a doc per version
add buttons to create New Version either as a copy of the template OR as "unattached" OR from a new doc (this saves as unattached)
Add Export to get the files out as copies


*1.1.18*
28 July 2015
"Zoom" function for Related To lists - allows user to open the Relation Object by clicking on the label.  If we have the 
definition of the object then it opens in a window, if not it opens the object in a webbrowser
also add the Task query for UnAssigned QA tasks


*1.1.17*
23 July 2015
Template formatting special!  fix the whole style problem - the code that inserts the clause into the control
was removing the last style which I think is what was causing the issue - code was there to get rid of the extra
\r that gets inserted when you insert text into the control.  change code to *just* get rid of that.  seems to work


*1.1.16* (changed numbering - last dot will be for small revisions so notes will just be for first 3)
22 July 2015
arg! turns out API 29.0 gives the combination field details in the detail layout as well as the edit layout
which I was exploiting to put all the fields in the layout even though it is based on the detail layout and not
edit layout.  API 34.0 gives the correct detail layout so doesn't give the combination fields which is correct 
but breaks what I want it to do!
*for now* move back to using 29.0 TODO fix the layouts so that they work with 34.0 (need to look up the combination field in the edit layout I think)

- bugs -
  P038/P039 - Issues creating a new object if there was only a Master record type - put in fix, can now create
  P007 - Blanche's reminder popup problem - cancel any new windows from the SSO login
	
 -Templates
  - Issue with the Template Editor - one of the templates had some crazy characters in it and the clean up code that inserts
  the clause xml into the control was getting confused cause range.characters.count <> range.end - always has before! so it was
  trimming where it shouldn't! put in fix that removes by going to selection.end and removing the extra returns
  - Inserting a Clause with a too long name - content controls can only have titles of 64 chars! woops - was throwing an error - update
    to trim to 64 chars for the title for both concepts and elements - doens't do anything just for display so doesn't matter

*1.1.0.15*
21 July 2015
- bugs -
  P038 - decimals in grid, use the Sforce decimals definition to format the grid field
  P036 - required fields, don't relly on SForce nillable, inforce the layout definitions which are actually diferent
  Issue with Template initially created, the GetAllElements was failing cause it didn't generate the SQL correctly - fix up to return just the structure if there are no clauses
  also in the ContractSideBare make sure that all data requests have handle data and change handledata to hide the progress window if there is an error


*1.1.0.14*
17 July 2015
- Templates 
  Update the New Clause so the selection is maximized to the start and end of the line, bit of logic if its already on the start or end of a line don't expand - this seems to fix the latest Rich Text error
  On insert of a clause, get the sidebar to update the concept list - this should fix Ora's dancing concept clone problem


*TODO*
  Playbook editor - need to switch to Telerik Rad editor - issues with HTML/Flowdoc convertion and that should look after it - plus supports red line and spellcheck which might be usefull?
  Template editor - default value - when you hit the concept it should select the current clause
  *speed* - cache all the clauses, put unshown clauses as custom xml components


*1.1.0.13*
17 July 2015
- change the filter to allow a default sort order with the OrderBy field on the Filters object entry
- change the filter so default actually creates the drop sown filter objects and calls them My ObjectName instead of My Records - can also define them in setting without the SOQL with name "My" or "All"
- add truncation to all the long text fields "Text__c" to 131,072 and add some other trunc values - need to change the saleforce save of the old way with the datasets to automatically truncate at one point!
- add definable filters to the tabs - this lets us create filters for sub objects - add ones for the Tasks
  as part of this add a return update from the button Apex class called Filter:{name} - this lets the apex code select the filter to select when it returns
  (this lets the clockstopper button switch from the Auto view to the Manual view where the new CS is shown)
- fix issue with the Matter Status isn't being selected on refresh - odd cb.Text = val isn't working - change it to loop through to selec
  (think this is because we're creating the combobox items as strings rather than comboboxitem objects - might be better to fix that - having to do a fiar bit of (type==string) do this or (type=RadComboboxItem) do that
- Add required indicator in the forms - bit tricky because it uses the detail layout to layout but the required is on the edit layout
- Fix for the problem when changing owners and then changing something and reloading - problem with the AxSearchBox control - set was trigetting events
- Update Partner API to 34.0 (I thought this might help with the Groups/Queues problem but it didn't!)
- Hardcode fix for Groups/Queues - If the relatedto object for a search box is Queue then change it to Groups with a type of Queue


*1.1.0.12*
3 July 2015
*Detail*
- fix the picklist problem - wasn't filtering for RecordType - add that in using picklistsForRecordType - step through the entries
  and remove any that aren't in the recordtype mapping list
- picklist if there is a value in the field that isn't in the pick list then add to the list - sort of works! comeback to the save issue which may be dependency or this
- fix issue with the breadcrumbs, filter change from 1.1.0.11 had broke it!
- add support for fields that have multiple controls like name and address - change to have a wrapping stack panel - means don't need the autowidth code which is good
  put the labels into a stackpanel as well if multiple - problem with the wrapping in the stack panel so only do if there are multiple - need to come back to
- Select the Ribbon by default when editing a Ribbon doc
- normal doc attachment - get it to open, close windows and activate the word doc
- Template stuff - switch to Telerik controls - add In Template Clause editing and Clause cloning
  Speed! mark each concept with the selected clause and last modified date - if they match don't load the clause get the xml from the template itself
  switch template editor to use that.  Switch the Contract sidebar to do the same thing (this needs to be rewitten with telerik controls and a datatables to cache - but for now have done it a is
  this will still be slow when there are a lot of clause choices because we have to get each clause that isn't the last selected one - could get round by caching the clause choices in the doc as 
  a xml part)
- playbook - add a playbook link to the template that maps to the salesforce field - add to contract so you can open the link from the contract creation
  move the playbook editor to the template - add a button to extract the footnotes and add them to the text
- settings changes - add order to the Task grid and add attachment to the matter
- for the buttons if sforce returns the id then select the returned id (for clockstopper creation)
- bugs - 
	owner and task order don't show in the grid - cause they aren't on the page layout - change code to get all the field not jsut the ones on the page layouts
	issues creating a new Task - the create was setting the values to null - no need on a create and it was causing proplems
	error when saving contract - name too big!

*1.1.0.11*
30 June 2015
*Detail*
- fix for Demo issue - have to save templatedocument first before you can save as Word - force save
- working on the template editor - switch the sidebar to Telerik controls and fix a bunch of bugs with editing 
- Request from John Mallon - add definable filters - define in the Ribbon settings - todo get these settings from salesforce
- fix bugs in the Grid view so we can show and search on relations 

*1.1.0.10*
23 June 2015
*Detail*
- Fix for demo versions to work, import negotation doesn't show dates as changes if there is no change 
- fix in the CleanUpXML and another break using FirstChild instead of InnerText - had bugs in original fix in 1.1.0.9
- force save when we export negotiation

*1.1.0.9*
18 June 2015
*Detail*
- Fix issue adding a clause section directly after a page break, insert now adds a new paragraph then the content control and then deletes the paragraph that was created
- Save XML error, if the Word document contained the char ascii30 (&#x1E) then when the clause tried to save the text, it gave an error that "&#x1E" is an invalid XML character
  fixed by adding a replace in CleanUpXML to change x1A-x1F to a regular "-" character - will only replace in the Text in salesforce, not the Attachment 
- Added the "Admin Menu" and "Reports" to the ReportsSettings in Salesforce, this sets what profiles see the templates and the link to the reports
